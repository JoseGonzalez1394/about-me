How did this go, overall?
It went surprisingly well and faster than I thought.

What observations or questions do you have about what you’ve learned so far?
The syntax and reason for Upper and Lower case function was more than I thought in the class; better understanding now after table discussion.

I like having previous repository I've made to refer to when stuck.

I feel like I am copying and pasting code a lot, all my own work, just feel like if it's right is there a faster and better way to do besides copy, cut, paste. 

How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?

Took me about an hour and a half.

Three to Four hours easy.
