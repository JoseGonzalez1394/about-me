      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>I am a first generation bilingual California native transitioning from the Army actively looking to pivot
        careers from healthcare to software development. My Mom is from Colombia and the guy who helped create me is
        from Mexico; I am the oldest of four. I am happily married to the most amazing, beautiful woman in the Air
        Force, goign on 6 years strong. I have one daughter that's four and another daughter on the way due in August.
        Currently transitiong careers, I was in the Army for 9 years and now working to be a full stack developer. As a
        kid, I've always wanted to make videogames so I figure right before I hit 30 young years of age, it's not too
        late, it's never too late?</p>
      <h2>Education History</h2>
      <p>I graduated from Paraclete Highschool in 2012. I have some college credits from several colleges and attempts
        at college but was too young and immature to take it seriously at the time. I ultimately joined the Army for a
        new career and serious change in my life, gut check time. I spent 9 yuears total in the Army, first contract was
        as a Motor Transport Operator and last contract became an LVN later specializing in dialysis. Now, I am enrolled
        in Code Fellows to learn full stack development, specializing in JAVA
